ABOUT:

This is a recreation of the classic word-game, “Hanged Man”, and played in terminal.  Offers over 5,000 words to challenge your brain’s ability to guess the word before your turns run out! (No stick-figures are harmed in playing the game…)

Rules:
- Computer randomly selects a word and displays empty letter slots for the player, indicating the secret word’s length (between 5-12 characters)
- Player attempts to guess the word by entering one letter at a time.  No need to guess the same letter multiple times! Once a letter is guessed, all instances of that letter in the secret word are revealed to the player.
- The player has 6 turns to guess the word correctly, or the game is over and the secret word is revealed.
- Game allows for saving and reloading so you can start and stop anytime.
